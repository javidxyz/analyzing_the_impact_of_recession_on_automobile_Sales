# Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes how economic recessions impact automobile sales using historical data and exploratory data analysis. By combining automobile sales data with macroeconomic indicators, the study highlights trends, patterns, and differences in sales behavior during recession and non-recession periods.

The goal is to understand **how sensitive the automobile industry is to economic downturns** and which factors influence sales the most.

---

##  Objectives

* Analyze automobile sales trends over time
* Compare sales performance during recession vs non-recession periods
* Study the relationship between sales and economic indicators such as GDP and unemployment
* Visualize insights using clear and interpretable charts

---

##  Dataset

The project uses:

* Historical automobile sales data
* Recession indicators
* Macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, unemployment rate, etc.)

**Source:** Publicly available datasets (as referenced in the notebook)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical analysis
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis and reporting

---

##  Key Analysis Performed

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Year-wise automobile sales trends
* Sales comparison during recession and non-recession periods
* Correlation analysis between economic indicators and sales
* Visualization dashboards for better interpretation

---

##  Key Insights

* Automobile sales show a **clear decline during recession periods**
* Higher unemployment and lower GDP growth correlate with reduced sales
* Recessions have a **lag effect**, where sales decline continues even after economic recovery begins

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mlubbad/analyzing_the_impact_of_recession_on_automobile_Sales.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run all cells in `main.jupyterlite.ipynb`

---

##  Limitations

* Data is aggregated and may not reflect regional or brand-specific behavior
* External factors like pandemics may distort recession patterns
* The project focuses on analysis, not high-accuracy prediction

---

##  Future Improvements

* Add predictive models to forecast sales during recessions
* Perform country-specific or segment-wise analysis
* Include consumer confidence and interest rate data

---

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how economic downturns significantly affect automobile sales and shows the importance of macroeconomic stability for the automotive industry. It provides a solid foundation for further predictive and policy-driven analysis.
